💊 Smart Dotage Care System (IoT Pill Dispenser)
This project implements an IoT-enabled system for elderly care, primarily functioning as a smart pill dispenser or remote monitoring unit. It uses a built-in web server for remote control and provides status feedback via an LCD.

The system is designed to run on a microcontroller with integrated WiFi, such as the TI CC3200 LaunchPad or a similar Energia-compatible board.

🌟 Key Features
WiFi Connectivity: Connects to a local network for remote access.

Integrated Web Server: Hosts a simple web page on port 80, accessible via any browser.

Remote Control: Allows a user to send basic commands (e.g., ON/OFF) by clicking buttons on the web page.

Real-time Status Display: Utilizes a 16x2 LCD to show system messages, connection status, and the device's IP address.

Automated Dispensing/Lid Mechanism: Controls a servo motor to automatically cycle through opening and closing positions, simulating a dispenser lid operation.

Indicators: Multiple digital outputs are available for controlling status LEDs or other indicators.
